Project Statement: Image Captioning is one of the advanced Deep Learning projects. This technique is used at Military forces, Traffic Violation, Medical, etc., In military, this model is used to caption the enemyâ€™s activity by looking at the satellite images and this captioning is done on the fly. In traffic Violations, this model will help identifying the unusual activities and so on. USE CASE: The Model will automatically be generating captions for given medical images, where the image could be one of many modalities, e.g., radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance, etc. The development of medical image captioning methods lays the groundwork for potential multimodal medical image analysis tools that could assist with clinical documentation, maintain and improve the consistency, quality, and efficiency of clinical reporting, produce rich textual descriptions from medical images, provide fast and inexpensive second readers, and help reduce teaching time. Outcomes: The model has to provide the caption of the image or the short summary of what the image is about.
